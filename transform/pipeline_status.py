"""Pipeline observability: turn the warehouse's own metadata into queryable tables.

Writes four flat tables into `analytics`:

* `pipeline_sources` — one row per dlt landing table: rows, span, when it loaded.
* `pipeline_tables`  — one row per table in every modelled layer: rows, year span.
* `pipeline_tests`   — one row per dbt test: what it guards and how many rows
  are currently failing it.
* `pipeline_runs`    — one row per node per dbt invocation: what ran, and how
  long it took. The only one that accumulates.

`reports/pages/pipeline.md` renders them. The first three are replaced each run;
`pipeline_runs` is appended, because each invocation's artifact is overwritten by
the next — so no rebuild can reproduce it, and `publish/restore_history.CARRIED`
carries it between releases.

The queries live in `gold_warehouse.observability`; this module holds the
project's landing tables and layer names. Run it after `dbt build`, whose audit
schema and artifacts it reads.

Run:  uv run python -m transform.pipeline_status
