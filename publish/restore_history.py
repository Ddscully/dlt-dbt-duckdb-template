"""Carry this warehouse's unreproducible tables forward from a published release.

Run:  uv run python -m publish.restore_history <previous warehouse.duckdb>
      (or `just restore-history prev/warehouse.duckdb`)

Every workflow builds from an empty file, so without this the published
snapshots would hold one version per row forever. Copying the previous release's
tables in *before* the graph runs lets `dbt snapshot` compare this month's
numbers against last month's and append real revisions; `pages.yml` borrows the
newest release the same way. When `lakehouse.tar.gz` sits beside the source
file the landing zone comes too, so the weather archive deepens instead of
cold-starting.

Unreproducible for different reasons, carried by one command: a snapshot or a
run record in principle (no rebuild can invent a past revision or a finished
invocation), the weather archive within a budget (refetching it costs more than
Open-Meteo's daily allowance).

It refuses to overwrite. A destination table with rows stops the restore unless
`--force`; a landing zone with rows, or dlt local state, stops it outright (see
`lake.lakehouse.preflight`). `just clean warehouse` asks the same question
through `irreplaceable_rows()`, so the two cannot drift. Each source relation
must also carry the columns that make it what it claims to be — see `Carry`.
