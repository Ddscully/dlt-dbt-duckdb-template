"""Build the Evidence site.

Wraps the npm commands the dashboard needs, in the order it needs them:

    npm ci / npm install          Evidence + its DuckDB adapter
    npm run sources[:strict]      warehouse tables -> reports/.evidence/ parquet
    npm run build                 parquet + markdown -> reports/build/ (static)

Run:  uv run python -m publish.build_report            (or `just report`)
      uv run python -m publish.build_report --clean    (or `just report-clean`)

The `reports/evidence_site` asset and `just report` both call this, so the two
cannot run different builds.

`evidence build` does not run the sources: it renders whatever parquet the
gitignored `reports/.evidence/` holds, so on a cold clone it succeeds and every
chart reads "Table … does not exist". `--strict` (the default here) makes an
empty or missing warehouse a non-zero exit instead.

`--clean` also drops `.evidence/`, whose cached per-source schemas do not notice
a column change (CI always starts cold). `build/` is emptied on every run
regardless — see `run()`. The file count still varies by one or two between
runs, because Evidence emits an `api/` route per query hash and the
`pipeline_*` queries carry load timestamps.

It does not touch `evidence.config.yaml`. A host that serves the site from a
subpath (GitHub Pages does) needs `deployment.basePath`, which Evidence reads
from the config and no env var; append it in the deploying workflow rather than
committing a value, which would break `npm run dev`.
