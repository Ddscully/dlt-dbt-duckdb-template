"""Unit tests for the one module every other layer's file locations come from.

What's worth pinning here isn't the happy path — this repo is an editable `src/`
install, so the in-tree branch always wins and nothing else ever runs. It's the
branches that only fire somewhere else: a consumer setting `PROJECT_ROOT`, and a
non-editable install started outside any project tree, where a cwd fallback
would hand back a plausible-looking path to a warehouse that doesn't exist.
