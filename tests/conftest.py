    records the result as the ambient pipeline. Any later test that calls a
    resource generator directly then reads the real `~/.dlt` state instead of no
    state, so an incremental resource asks for a lookback window the test never
    set up. It fails only when the whole suite runs, only on a machine that has
    loaded that resource at least once, and blames whatever the changed URL
    broke.

    Shared here because `test_asset_checks.py` and `test_definitions.py` both
    import the orchestration layer. Module scope means each test module still
    gets its own teardown.
