    """Importing `orchestration.assets` leaves a dlt pipeline *active* process-wide.

    The `@dlt_assets` decorators call `build_pipeline()` at import time, and dlt
    records the result as the ambient pipeline. Any later test that calls a
    resource generator directly — `pipeline.wb_wdi()` in `tests/test_ingest.py`
    does — then reads the real `~/.dlt` state instead of no state, so
    `wdi_start_year` returns a lookback window and the URL grows a `&date=` the
    test never asked for. It fails only when the whole suite runs, only on a
    machine that has loaded WDI at least once, and names pagination as the
    culprit.

    Shared here because `test_asset_checks.py` and `test_definitions.py` both
    import the orchestration layer. Module scope means each test module still
    gets its own teardown.
