"""The course material and the project skills, checked against the repo they cite.

`docs/course/` and `.agents/skills/*/SKILL.md` quote file paths, `just` recipes
and module links out of the rest of the tree. None of that is executable, so it
rots the way an exposure does: the module still renders and reads correctly, and
the path it tells a learner to open was renamed six commits ago. A course that
sends someone to a missing file is worse than no course, because the reader
assumes they are the one who is wrong.

The same argument as `tests/test_exposures.py` and `tests/test_report.py`: an
assertion about the *outside* of a system needs a test on the outside of it.

No warehouse and no dbt manifest here — `just test` has neither, so everything
