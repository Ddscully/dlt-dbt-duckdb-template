"""The declared consumers, checked against the ones that actually exist.

`dbt/models/_exposures.yml` says which models each Evidence page and the monthly
data release depend on. Nothing in dbt can verify that — an exposure is an
assertion about the *outside* of the project, so a stale one is invisible: `dbt
build` stays green, `dbt ls --select +exposure:*` keeps answering, and the answer
is quietly wrong. These tests are the other half of it, resolving page → source
query → warehouse table from the Evidence tree and comparing.

No warehouse and no dbt manifest here (`just test` has neither — the manifest is
gitignored and built later in CI), so everything below reads the yml and the SQL
as text.
