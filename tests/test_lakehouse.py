"""The lakehouse: dlt's landing zone, and the revision log derived from it.

dlt writes the catalog directly, so what is left to guard is the substitute for
DuckLake's change feed.

**Why there is a substitute at all** is the finding these tests exist to hold.
`ducklake_table_changes()` is the obvious answer and it does not work behind
dlt: reloading 500 identical rows through `write_disposition="merge"` reports
`update_preimage: 500, update_postimage: 500`, because dlt regenerates `_dlt_id`
*and* `_dlt_load_id` on every row it touches. The feed is faithful and the
writer is what makes it useless. `revisions()` diffs two snapshots with `EXCEPT`
instead, projecting those columns away.

The failure that matters is not an exception. Drop a column from the ignore list
and the diff returns *every* row as revised — a plausible number, in the right
shape, that reads as a catastrophic upstream restatement. So the tests here
assert the zero as hard as they assert the one.
