"""`AGENTS.md` is the instructions file; the other agents' entry points must reach it.

Every agent reads its own path, and each way of pointing one at the shared copy
fails without an error:

- Claude Code reads `CLAUDE.md`, never `AGENTS.md`, so the shared file reaches it
  only through an `@AGENTS.md` import. Delete that line and Claude starts every
  session with the plugin section and nothing else.
- Claude Code reads skills only from `.claude/skills/`, and Codex only from
  `.agents/skills/`. One is a symlink to the other; a real directory in its
  place is a second copy of eighteen skills, drifting from the first.
- Codex reads `project_doc_max_bytes` of `AGENTS.md` — 32 KiB by default — and
  cuts the rest, saying so only in a trace log. The budget is one number for
  every `AGENTS.md` from the repo root down to the working directory, root
  first, and it is user configuration the repo cannot set.
- A skill is chosen by its frontmatter `description`, which is YAML. In an
  unquoted scalar ` #` starts a comment, so everything after it is dropped and
  the agent is shown the truncated text — the skill still loads, and a session
  whose task matched only the lost half never picks it.

symlink), and openai/codex `codex-rs/core/src/agents_md.rs` (`data.truncate`
