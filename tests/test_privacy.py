"""The classification layer and the pseudonymisation at the publication boundary.

Two halves, and they check different kinds of thing.

The **mechanism** half builds a miniature warehouse in a tmp dir — a landing
table, a view over it and a mart, which is the shape that makes the boundary
policy hard — and asserts what the rewrite does to it. No real warehouse, no
network.

The **coverage** half reads the ymls as text. `just test` has no dbt manifest
(it is gitignored and built later in CI), so the same constraint that shapes
`tests/test_exposures.py` applies here: the declarations are checked as
documents. What it enforces is not "every column is labelled" — that would be
paperwork — but that a column *sharing a name with a classified one* is never
left silently unlabelled, which is the way a classification actually rots.
