"""Counts cited in prose must match what dbt actually builds.

A derived total written into prose is an assertion nothing else checks:
`just lint`, `pytest` and `dbt build` all stay green while a README cites last
month's test count. Each scan here finds a number in front of a counted noun in
tracked prose and checks it against the manifest.

**What this does not check.** A project-wide total is accepted in any sentence,
including one about a single model, and any of the project totals satisfies any
project-wide sentence. Anchoring each citation to its own site would close that
and drift on every reflow; this catches the class that has actually broken — a
number that is no longer any of the true ones.
