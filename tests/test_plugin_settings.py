    measurement). `ty-lsp` is the one kept because Astral's server runs
    `uvx ty@latest`, the newest ty on every launch, against a `just typecheck`
    that runs the version in `uv.lock` — and ty's diagnostics move between patch
    releases, so the editor would show findings the recipe cannot reproduce.

    The `astral-sh` marketplace stays registered, so re-enabling is a one-line
    edit — and if you make it, put `astral` **after** `ty-lsp` in
    `enabledPlugins` (it sorts first, so alphabetising the file hands `.py` to
    the unpinned server) and expect its LSP to stay dead.
