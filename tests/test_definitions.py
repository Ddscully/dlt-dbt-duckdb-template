"""Every asset and check in `assets.py` is registered in `definitions.py`.

`dg.Definitions` takes an explicit list, and nothing complains about an omission:
the asset simply isn't in the graph, so `AssetSelection.all()` never sees it and
`dagster definitions validate` passes. An unlisted asset fails somewhere
downstream; an unlisted check fails *silently*, because it just never runs.

The explicit list stays (it is the one place that says what the graph is); this
is what makes forgetting it loud.
