"""`pages.yml`'s path allowlist classifies every tracked file, both ways.

That workflow is a full ingest -> dbt -> Polars -> Evidence run against the live
public APIs, so a docs-only push should not trigger it. The filter is an
allowlist rather than `paths-ignore`, because the dashboard *is* markdown
(`reports/pages/`) and a blanket `**.md` ignore would stop republishing the site
exactly when a page changed. But a hand-maintained allowlist can omit a new
build input in silence, and the only symptom is a site that stops moving.

So every tracked file must be claimed by exactly one side: the allowlist in the
workflow, or `NOT_A_SITE_INPUT` below. A new path claimed by neither is a red
test asking someone to decide.

    * `LAKEHOUSE_DIR` — dlt *lands* in the lakehouse, so without it the slice
      merges into a landing zone holding a weather archive no rebuild affords.
    * `DBT_RUN_RESULTS_PATH` (with `--target-path`) — dbt writes its artifacts
      to `dbt/target/` wherever the build pointed, and `analytics.pipeline_runs`
      records whatever that file last held, so the next `just pipeline-status`
      would file the fixture timings in the real warehouse's build history.
    * `DBT_MANIFEST_PATH` — the same directory, so the test inventory reads the
      fixture build's manifest rather than a real one alongside it.

    Asserted as a set rather than by reading the recipe's behaviour, because
    each is invisible when missing: the fixture run still passes, and what
