"""The bus matrix is derived, and these are what make the derivation trustworthy.

The matrix in `docs/WAREHOUSE.md` says which conformed dimensions each fact
carries. Nothing in dbt can check that: a fact keyed on a column no dimension
publishes builds green, passes its contract and passes its grain test, because
every other guard in this repo is scoped to a single relation.

So the derivation has to be right about two things that are easy to get wrong,
and both are pinned below with the real model that would break them:

- a uniqueness test carrying a `where` is a conditional assertion, not a grain
- a versioned model is two published relations, not one

The third test is the matrix itself: the facts that join to nothing are declared
in `publish/bus_matrix.py` with a reason each, and compared both ways — so a new
orphan fails, and so does fixing one without deleting its entry.
