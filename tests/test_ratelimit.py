"""Unit tests for the weighted sliding-window limiter.

The interesting cases here are not "does the arithmetic work". They are the
three the module was written around, each of which a plausible implementation
gets wrong while looking right:

* the **widest** window is what binds on a long run, not the narrowest;
* a request larger than a whole window's budget must still terminate;
* the charge lands *after* the call, so a 429 must not be charged twice.

Time is injected rather than slept, so a simulated 24-hour backfill runs in
microseconds. A real `time.sleep` here would make the file take a day.
