These are the tests the retail fixture deliberately can't be: it holds one sheet,
because DuckDB's xlsx writer replaces a file per `COPY` and a two-sheet workbook
would have to be assembled by hand at the zip level. So the multi-sheet
behaviour is pinned here instead, against workbooks built for the purpose — and
more sharply than a fixture could, because these can be *wrong* on purpose.
