"""Unit tests for the publishable artifact (`publish/export_warehouse.py`).

These build a miniature warehouse in a tmp dir rather than reading
`data/warehouse.duckdb` — no network, no fixtures, no dependency on whether the
real pipeline has been run. What's worth asserting is the packaging contract, not
the numbers: which schemas ship, that the manifest describes what's on disk, and
that the `staging` views still resolve after the database is copied.

Every fixture names its `lakehouse_dir` rather than defaulting it. The default is
`lake.lakehouse.LAKEHOUSE_DIR`, the developer's real landing zone, so the export's
shape would otherwise depend on whether that machine had ever ingested — green in
CI, which builds from nothing, and different on a laptop.
