# Evidence dashboard

[Evidence.dev](https://evidence.dev) is "BI as code": SQL + markdown compile to a
static site, deployable free to GitHub Pages.

This folder is a working Evidence project wired to the repo's DuckDB warehouse.

## Prerequisites

Build the warehouse first (Evidence reads `../data/warehouse.duckdb`):

```bash
just run        # ingest -> dbt build -> polars transform
```

## Develop / build

```bash
cd reports
npm install       # first time
npm run dev       # local preview at http://localhost:3000
npm run sources   # extract the warehouse tables -> .evidence/ parquet
npm run build     # static site -> build/ (deploy to GitHub Pages)
```

Or from the repo root: `just report` (which runs all three), `just report-clean`
to drop the schema cache first.

**`npm run build` does not run the sources.** It renders against whatever
parquet `.evidence/` already holds, and `.evidence/` is gitignored, so a build
from a fresh clone succeeds and produces a site where every chart reads
*Table with name emissions_energy does not exist*. `npm run dev` extracts them
for you, which is why this only ever bites in CI.

## The site is a Dagster asset

`reports/evidence_site` (in `orchestration/assets.py`) builds this folder, so the
dashboard is the last node of the asset graph rather than something built beside
it. `publish/build_report.py` is the implementation, the same one `just report`
calls, so the recipe and the graph can't drift into running different builds.

- It declares **one dep per table the source queries read** (20 tables today),
  and `tests/test_report.py` fails if a new source query reads a table
  none of them covers. Adding `sources/warehouse/foo.sql` on a new mart therefore
  means adding a line to `TABLE_TO_DBT_MODEL` in `publish/build_report.py`; see
  `just test`'s failure message, which says exactly which table is unclaimed.
- It is the only asset **excluded from the `full_refresh` job**, because it needs
  Node and three workflows run that job on a Python-only checkout.
  `just materialize-site` (`publish_site`) is the one that includes it.
- A blocking asset check, `site_pages_all_rendered`, asserts every `pages/*.md`
  produced HTML, because `evidence build` exits 0 for a site missing a page.

## How it's wired

- `sources/warehouse/connection.yaml`: DuckDB source pointing at the warehouse file.
- `sources/warehouse/*.sql`: source queries that read the dbt/Polars outputs
  (`marts.fct_emissions_energy`, `analytics.co2_intensity`,
  `marts.fct_eu_electricity_prices_semiannual`, the spine, the snapshot summary
  and the `pipeline_*` tables). Referenced in pages as
  `warehouse.emissions_energy`, `warehouse.co2_intensity`,
  `warehouse.eu_electricity_prices_semiannual`, and so on: the filename is the
  reference name.
- `pages/index.md`: the home page, an interactive explorer driven by a year
  selector: clean electricity vs. life expectancy (bubble), CO₂ intensity by
  income group over time (line), a grid carbon-intensity ranking and a
  most-efficient table. Its last section is the exception: EU prices half by
  half, from the semi-annual fact, deliberately covering the whole series rather
  than the selected year, because the annual average the other charts use hides
  moves of 300%+ inside a single year.
- `pages/findings.md`: seven written-up findings from the same two tables. Each
  section leads with its chart and puts the reading of it underneath; the notes
  on method sit at the bottom of the page.
- `pages/coverage.md`: what each source actually covers, built by left-joining
  `marts.fct_emissions_energy` onto the `dim_country_year` spine so a gap is a
  row rather than an absence. Read this before writing a `where` clause against
  the mart, since the 79/210/217-country ceilings live here.
- `pages/pipeline.md`: the state of the pipeline itself, with dlt load times,
  rows per layer, and every dbt test with its stored-failure count. Reads the
  three `analytics.pipeline_*` tables written by `transform/pipeline_status.py`
  (`just pipeline-status`, part of `just run`).
- `pages/restatements.md`: what OWID has revised since this warehouse first
  loaded it, off the dbt snapshot.
- `pages/scope2.md`: the same grid carbon-intensity series the other pages chart,
  read as the location-based Scope 2 emission factor it also is —
  `marts.dim_grid_emission_factors` as a reference table with its vintage and
  lineage, a worked example over twelve *invented* sites
  (`marts.fct_example_scope2_emissions`), and the three caveats a practitioner
  checks. It is the one page whose data is partly fabricated, which is stated in
  an `<Alert>` directly above the table rather than in a footnote.
- `pages/cbam.md`: what a tonne of an imported CBAM good costs at the EU border,
  by where it was made — `marts.fct_cbam_exposure`, i.e. Annex I of Implementing
  Regulation (EU) 2025/2621 times a carbon price. The one page driven by a
  *string* input: the `<Dropdown>` picks a `good_key`, so its SQL interpolates as
  `where good_key = '${inputs.good.value}'` with the quotes written by hand —
  Evidence hands the value back as a raw SQL fragment, not a bound parameter.
  Its `goods_list` query also groups by the two selected columns, so
  `order by product_group` is a binder error; order by the label instead.
- `pages/currency.md`: the ECB's daily euro reference rates — the gap in the
  calendar, the carry-forward that fills it, spot against average, and the EU
  electricity price restated in dollars. Two things it demonstrates that no other
  page needed:
  - **Put a real date on a time axis, not the period label.** Charting
    `period_label` gave 27 category ticks rendered as `2...` and sorted as
    strings; `x=period_start_date` with `xFmt='yyyy'` is what makes it readable.
    Same for the half-yearly price chart (`xFmt='yyyy-mmm'`).
  - It is the second page driven by a *string* input (`currency_code`), so the
    hand-written quotes in `'${inputs.ccy.value}'` are the cbam.md pattern again,
    and the selection is named in prose as `{inputs.ccy.label}` — a `<Value>`
    would show the first row of a query rather than what the reader picked.
- `pages/retail.md`: one retailer's invoice lines, the only page below country
  grain. What counts as revenue once stock write-offs and bad-debt adjustments
  are separated out, a cohort retention heatmap, RFM segments from
  `analytics.retail_rfm`, and returns matched to their sale by inference. Its
  heatmap is where the `*_pct` auto-format trap below was found.

The coverage and pipeline pages render an explanatory branch rather than an
error when their data is empty, the way `restatements.md` does, because the
published copy is always built from scratch.

## No hardcoded years

`sources/warehouse/latest_years.sql` returns one row holding the latest year each
metric family can populate, and every `where year = …` in the pages reads from
it. Pages pick it up with a page-level query block, which is what makes it
referenceable in both SQL and markdown:

```sql
select * from warehouse.latest_years
```

...then `(select co2_year from ${latest_years})` inside a query.

**It is not `max(year)`.** The mart sits on a country-year spine, so its max year
is whichever source runs furthest ahead: Eurostat prices, currently a year beyond
everything else. Coverage also falls off at different rates per column.
`primary_energy_twh` drops from ~210 countries to 79 in the latest year, while
`co2_mt` holds at 214, so cutting an energy chart to the latest CO₂ year silently
discards two thirds of its sample. Each family gets its own floor; see the
comment block at the top of that file.

Adding a chart on a new column? Check its coverage curve first
(`select year, count(col) from marts.fct_emissions_energy group by year`), and add
a family to `latest_years.sql` if the existing ones don't fit.

## Pages (`pages/`)

Add a `.md` file per page; each runs SQL against the `warehouse` source and
renders charts. See the [Evidence docs](https://docs.evidence.dev) for components.

Sidebar order comes from a numeric `sidebar_position` in the frontmatter; pages
carrying one sort ahead of every page without one, and ties fall back to the
*filename*, not the title. `sidebar_badge: <text>` puts a badge beside the label
(used here to mark the method and ops pages as skippable). There is no
`sidebar_label` in this version — the nav label is the `title`, and the anchors
carry `capitalize`, so a title with a lowercase preposition renders title-cased.

## Reserved page names

**`explore`, `settings` and `api` are taken.** Evidence's template ships its own
`pages/explore/` (the SQL console and schema browser) and `pages/settings/`, so a
page you name `explore.md` is never copied into `.evidence/template/src/pages/`.
The build then fails on:

```
[ERROR]: Internal Error | /api/[...route]/evidencemeta.json
  url: 'http://sveltekit-prerender/api/explore/evidencemeta.json', status: 500
```

which names neither your page nor the collision, and `just report-clean` does not
help because nothing is stale. Rename the page. The country explorer here is
`pages/countries.md` for this reason.

## `<BoxPlot color=…>` does the opposite of what it looks like

Passing `color` to a `BoxPlot` **rainbow-colours every box** instead of setting
one colour. `Box.svelte` reads `colorBy: $colorStore ? 'data' : 'series'`, so
supplying a colour switches ECharts to per-*item* colouring and each category
takes the next palette entry — which on a time axis implies the years encode
something. **Omit `color` entirely** to get a single themed box, which is almost
always what you want. This is the reverse of `LineChart` and `BarChart`, where
`color` sets one series colour as expected.

## Reserved column names in charts

**Never name a charted column `tests` or `rows`.** They collide with Evidence's
chart internals, and the failure is silent and convincing: the BarChart renders
its axis, its categories and its value labels correctly, and simply draws no
bars. No console error, no build failure, no empty-data warning. The chart just
looks like every value is zero while the labels next to it say otherwise.

`pipeline.md` hit this twice. Renaming to `n_tests` fixed it with no other
change. `DataTable` is unaffected, so a column can be fine in a table on the same
page and barless in a chart three lines below it. If a chart renders labels but
no marks, rename the column before debugging anything else.

**One false alarm.** A headless screenshot with too small a
`--virtual-time-budget` produces the *identical* symptom (axis, categories and
value labels, no bars) and does it to a different chart on each run, because the
budget expires part-way through rendering a long page. `scope2.md` has three
charts, and 25 s left one of them blank each time, varying. 60 s renders all
three, repeatably. Before believing a chart is broken, shoot it twice: a real
failure is the same chart every time.

## A scatter over 3,000 points stops rendering

**ECharts switches a scatter series to *progressive* rendering at
`progressiveThreshold: 3000` points** — chunked, one slice per animation frame —
and Evidence exposes neither that nor `progressive`. The day-one chart on
`retail.md` is 4,868 points and never finished at all: a headless screenshot that
takes 1 s for the same chart at 2,900 points sat for twelve minutes at 4,871 and
had to be killed.

The numbers say it is a mode change at a threshold and not a volume problem:
2,900 points render in 2 s, 4,871 never finish, and 4,871 with progressive
disabled render in **1 s**. So the fix is two lines:

```
seriesOptions={{progressive: 0, progressiveThreshold: 100000}}
```

Trimming the query would have looked like a fix and left the next chart to
rediscover the same thing.

## Log axes: `yLog=true` silently does nothing

Three separate traps, all met on the same chart.

- **There is no `xLog` prop.** `ScatterPlot` takes `yLog` and `yLogBase`; `xType`
  only accepts category / value / time. A log x axis has to go through
  `echartsOptions={{xAxis: {type: 'log'}}}`.
- **`yLog=true` in a page does not turn the axis on.** `_Chart.svelte` sets
  `yType = yLog === true ? 'log' : 'value'` in a prop initialiser, which runs
  once, and markdown passes `yLog=true` as the **string** `"true"`. The later
  `$: yLog = toBoolean(yLog)` fixes the variable and never re-runs `yType`. The
  axis stays linear and nothing warns. `yLog={true}` does set it — and then picks
  a 1-to-10 range with the data four orders of magnitude above. Setting
  `yAxis: {type: 'log'}` through `echartsOptions` is the spelling that works.
- **`min`/`max` inside `echartsOptions` lose to the component**, which writes its
  own `min: yMin` / `max: yMax`. Use the `yMin` / `yMax` props.

And one consequence: on a log y axis the **`yAxisTitle` disappears**, because
Evidence draws it as part of the topmost axis label. Name the axis in the chart's
`subtitle` instead.

## A log axis will happily span fifteen orders of magnitude for two rows

`where net_revenue_gbp > 0` is not the same filter as "positive", and the
difference is a chart nobody can read. Two customers bought and returned
everything; the signed line amounts do not cancel to exactly zero in floating
point, so they sit at 3.6e-15 and 2.8e-14. Both pass `> 0`. The log axis then
ran from 0.0000000001 to 10,000,000,000 to fit them, flattening the other 4,866
points into one band.

Threshold on a real unit, `>= 0.01` for money, not on zero. The same arithmetic
is why a `first_order_gbp <= net_revenue_gbp` dbt test fails on 272 rows that are
equal; see the retail section of `AGENTS.md`.

## Years render as `2025.0` unless you cast twice

**Evidence's DuckDB extractor writes every numeric column to parquet as
`DOUBLE`**, whatever it was in the warehouse. Page queries run in the browser
against *that*, so `cast(year as varchar)` in a page produces `'2025.0'` — a
string, so no `fmt` can rescue it, and it lands in the BigValue, the DataTable
cell and the chart's category axis looking like a bug in the data.

Which of the two fixes you want depends on where the value goes:

- **A number rendered as a number** (DataTable column, BigValue): leave the year
  numeric and pass `fmt="0"`.
- **A number that has to be a string** (a chart's category axis, a label
  concatenated into text): `cast(cast(year as integer) as varchar)`. The integer
  cast is the load-bearing half.

`latest_years.sql` sidesteps it by casting in the *source* query, which runs
server-side before the extraction — hence its `*_label` columns. Anything
computed on a page has to do it the long way; `scope2.md` has both forms with the
reason inline.

## A paragraph that *starts* with a component loses its spacing

A paragraph beginning with `<Value .../>` is treated as an HTML block, so the
markdown processor never wraps it in `<p class="markdown">` and it renders hard
against the paragraph below with no margin between them. Nothing errors, and it
only shows up in a browser.

Put a word in front of the component and the paragraph is wrapped normally:
`In total <Value .../> lines, …` rather than `<Value .../> lines, …`.

This only applies to the first line of a *paragraph*. A component that starts a
wrapped line **inside** a paragraph is fine and is sometimes deliberate, as in
`findings.md`, where a sentence continues onto a line beginning with a `<Value>`.
Check for a blank line above before "fixing" one.

## A column named `*_pct` is silently multiplied by 100

**Evidence infers a format from the column *name*.** `lookupColumnFormat` takes
everything after the last underscore and looks it up as a format tag, so a
column called `retention_pct` matches the built-in `pct` format — which assumes
the value is a fraction and multiplies it by 100. This warehouse stores
percentages **0–100**, so the two conventions collide and a 37.57% retention
figure renders as `3,757%`.

It costs nothing on most charts here purely by accident: every one of them
already passes an explicit `fmt` / `yFmt` / `valueFmt`, and an explicit format
wins over the name lookup. The bug only appears on a component where you didn't
think a format was needed — a `<Heatmap>`'s color legend, an axis you left
alone. `retail.md`'s cohort heatmap shipped that way and read `263%` to
`3,757%` for a column whose real range is 2.63 to 37.57.

So: **pass an explicit format to anything that renders a `*_pct` column**, and
if a percentage ever looks like it has two extra digits, check the column name
before you check the SQL.

The suffix is matched against every tag in `builtInFormats.js`, so `_pct` is not
the only one: `id`, `fract`, `mult`, `sci`, `num0`…`num4`, `yyyy`, `mmm` and the
date tags are all live. Currency suffixes are *not* on that list, which is why
`revenue_gbp` and `gdp_usd` pass through untouched and `_pct` is the one that
bites here. A column named `customer_id` does pick up the `id` format. That one
is harmless — it suppresses thousands separators, which is what you want for an
identifier — but it looks like a bug until you know.

## Chart colors

`evidence.config.yaml` sets a `theme.colorPalettes.default` and brand colors
(`primary`/`accent`/`base-100`/etc.) chosen for both light and dark mode against
the colorblind (protanopia/deuteranopia) and normal-vision separation floors —
unlike Evidence's stock palette, whose first few slots are all
near-indistinguishable blues. **That is not every pair clearing every floor.**
Series that sit next to each other in palette order need only the cheaper
*adjacent* check; a scatter or bubble chart, where any two points can be
neighbours, needs *all-pairs*, and only a few subsets of the eight clear it. The
bullets below name them.

Charts with a fixed, small set of categories pass an explicit `seriesColors`
map instead of relying on the global palette's implicit ordering, so a series
always gets the same color regardless of how the query happens to sort it:

- **`income_group`** (`stg_country`'s income ladder, High → Low, 4 categories)
  appears in `index.md`'s bubble/line/scatter charts. It's technically ordinal
  (High → Low is a ladder), which argues for a single-hue light→dark ramp,
  but with 4 overlapping categories on a scatter/bubble, adjacent ramp steps
  read as near-identical at a glance even though they clear the colorblind
  checks. Traded that for four fully distinct hues (blue/gold/magenta/green),
  which loses the "high-to-low" gradient reading but wins at-a-glance
  separation. This is the one series in the report where 4 categories share a
  chart that needs the *all-pairs* check (any two bubbles/points can be
  neighbors) rather than the cheaper *adjacent* check. This hue set is one of
  only two 4-color subsets of the documented 8 that clear all-pairs at all, and
  even it carries two WARN-tier flags (a light-mode contrast dip on gold/
  magenta, a dark-mode colorblind-separation dip on green/gold) that the
  legend + hover tooltip mitigate rather than eliminate. Don't push income_group
  past 4 categories without re-running the validator.
- **`income_group` also drives the peak-emissions scatter in `findings.md`**, but
  only the three categories present among large emitters that have already
  peaked (High/Upper-middle/Lower-middle, since no Low-income country clears the
  200 Mt threshold). That's a different `seriesColors` map from `index.md`'s
  four-category one: the first three palette slots (blue/orange/aqua), which
  are the ones that clear the *all-pairs* check on their own, with no need for
  `index.md`'s special-cased four-hue set. Still-rising countries are
  excluded from that scatter entirely (their "change since peak" is 0% by
  construction, so they'd all stack on one point) and broken out in a bar
  chart instead.
- **Binary progress/business-as-usual series** (`decoupled` and `direction` in
  `findings.md`) reuses the same two hues throughout: blue for the "improving"
  side, orange for the opposite. Deliberately not red/green, which fails the
  colorblind check outright (ΔE ~4, well under the ~6 floor) despite looking
  fine to most readers.
- **"Two ways of measuring the same quantity" always gets aqua/gold**
  (`#1baf7a`/`#eda100` light, `#199e70`/`#c98500` dark). Three charts in
  `findings.md` use it: CO₂ share vs. population share, territorial vs.
  consumption-based emissions, and share of the cumulative stock vs. share of
  the current flow. They are not good/bad pairs, so borrowing the progress hues
  would import a value judgment the chart isn't making; using one consistent
  pair for the role means a reader who has decoded one of the three has decoded
  all of them.

Adding a new `series=` chart? Pick colors from the same validated set in
`evidence.config.yaml` rather than eyeballing new hex values, and if two
categories carry a value judgment (good/bad, on-track/off-track), avoid a
red/green pairing.

## Deploying to GitHub Pages

The site is fully static. `.github/workflows/pages.yml` materializes the
`publish_site` job (the whole pipeline against the live sources plus this site)
and publishes `reports/build/`. `sources:strict`, which the asset runs, makes a
missing or empty warehouse fail the build instead of deploying an empty
dashboard.

Three things nobody tells you, if you're setting this up yourself:

- **Pages has to be enabled once by hand**: Settings → Pages → Source → GitHub
  Actions.
- **`evidence build` does not run the sources.** It renders against whatever
  parquet `.evidence/` already holds, which locally is a warm cache and in CI is
  nothing at all, so `sources:strict` has to run first. Skip it and you deploy a
  perfectly working site where every chart says *Table with name emissions_energy
  does not exist*. That ordering lives in `publish/build_report.py`, the single
  implementation behind both `just report` and the asset.
- **Project Pages serve from a subpath**, so the workflow appends
  `deployment.basePath` to `evidence.config.yaml` at build time. It's injected
  rather than committed because a base path set in the file also applies to `npm
  run dev`, which breaks local preview on `localhost:3000`. Evidence has no
  env-var equivalent.
