title: Pipeline
description: The state of the pipeline that built this site, from load times to layer sizes and every dbt test.
sidebar_position: 10
sidebar_badge: Ops
---

Operational state of the pipeline behind this site: when each source last loaded,
how many rows survived each layer, and the current result of every data-quality
test.

```sql test_summary
select
    count(*)                              as total_tests,
    count(*) filter (where status = 'fail') as failing_tests,
    sum(failing_rows)                     as failing_rows,
    count(distinct tested_model)          as models_covered
from warehouse.pipeline_tests
```

```sql layer_summary
select
    (select count(*) from warehouse.pipeline_sources) as sources,
    (select sum(rows) from warehouse.pipeline_sources) as source_rows,
    (select sum(rows) from warehouse.pipeline_tables) as modelled_rows
```

<Grid cols=4>
    <BigValue data={test_summary} value=total_tests title="dbt tests"/>
    <BigValue data={test_summary} value=failing_tests title="Failing"/>
    <BigValue data={layer_summary} value=source_rows fmt="#,##0" title="Rows landed"/>
    <BigValue data={layer_summary} value=modelled_rows fmt="#,##0" title="Rows modelled"/>
</Grid>

## Source freshness

```sql sources
select source_table, rows, year_min, year_max, loaded_at
from warehouse.pipeline_sources
order by rows desc
```

<DataTable data={sources} rows=5>
    <Column id=source_table title="Landing table"/>
    <Column id=rows title="Rows" fmt="#,##0"/>
    <Column id=year_min title="From" fmt="0"/>
    <Column id=year_max title="To" fmt="0"/>
    <Column id=loaded_at title="Loaded" fmt="yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm"/>
</DataTable>

`loaded_at` comes from dlt's `_dlt_load_id`, a unix epoch stamped at ingest. It
measures **our load, not the publisher's release**: a stale timestamp here means
the pipeline stopped running, not that OWID stopped publishing. That is also why
it is tautologically green on a freshly built copy of this site, since the build
loads the data and then reports on the load.

Note the two distinct timestamps. Four resources load with `replace` and three
load incrementally, and `refresh` is an argument to a dlt *run*, not a property
of a resource, so a single run cannot refresh the first group while leaving the
second alone. It is two loads, seconds apart, and this table is where that shows
up.

## What each layer holds

```sql tables
select layer, table_name, rows, year_min, year_max
from warehouse.pipeline_tables
order by layer, table_name
```

<DataTable data={tables} rows=10>
    <Column id=layer title="Layer"/>
    <Column id=table_name title="Table"/>
    <Column id=rows title="Rows" fmt="#,##0"/>
    <Column id=year_min title="From" fmt="0"/>
    <Column id=year_max title="To" fmt="0"/>
</DataTable>

`marts.dim_country_year` is larger than the fact it feeds, and that is the
design: the spine is the complete cross join, the fact is the part of it any
source reports. The difference is the subject of the [coverage page](/coverage).

The two `history` tables, `snap_co2_estimates` and `snap_grid_emission_factors`,
are the ones a rebuild cannot reproduce. Every other row above is derivable from
the sources. Those two are accumulated state, and deleting the warehouse destroys
them for good.

## Test coverage

```sql tests_by_model
-- `n_tests`, not `tests`, even though this one now feeds a table. A column
-- called `tests` collides with something inside Evidence's chart components: a
-- BarChart renders its axis, categories and value labels perfectly and simply
-- draws no bars, with no error anywhere. `rows` behaves the same way — fine in a
-- DataTable, silently barless in a chart. The rename is the only fix, and it is
-- cheaper to keep the safe name than to remember which query is which.
select
    tested_model,
    count(*)          as n_tests,
    sum(failing_rows) as n_failing_rows
from warehouse.pipeline_tests
where tested_model is not null
group by tested_model
order by n_tests desc
```

<DataTable data={tests_by_model} rows={12}>
    <Column id=tested_model title="Model"/>
    <Column id=n_tests title="Tests" contentType=bar/>
    <Column id=n_failing_rows title="Failing rows" fmt="#,##0"/>
</DataTable>

```sql tests_by_type
select test_type, count(*) as tests
from warehouse.pipeline_tests
group by test_type
order by tests desc
```

<DataTable data={tests_by_type} rows=6>
    <Column id=test_type title="Test type"/>
    <Column id=tests title="Count" fmt="0"/>
</DataTable>

The distribution is deliberate. `accepted_range` dominates because the failure
mode this warehouse actually has is a plausible-looking wrong number, not a
missing one: a unit error, a percentage over 100, a year outside a source's
range. The `unique_combination_of_columns` tests are the grain contract,
`(country_iso3, year)` on every fact-shaped model, which is what catches a
duplicate on either side of a join fanning rows out downstream.

`dbt_project.yml` also sets `+store_failures: true` project-wide, so a test does
not just return a count. It leaves the offending rows behind in
`dbt_test__audit.<test_name>`, and a red check gives you the rows rather than a
number.

The bounds are calibrated to fail on bugs and not on reality, which sometimes
means *not* testing a column. `trade_co2_share` has no range test because its
real range runs from about −98% to +1023%, and `income_group` is nullable on
purpose because the World Bank does not classify every territory.

## Currently failing

```sql failing
select test_name, test_type, tested_model, tested_column, failing_rows, audit_table
from warehouse.pipeline_tests
where status = 'fail'
order by failing_rows desc
```

{#if failing.length > 0}

<DataTable data={failing} rows=20>
    <Column id=test_name title="Test"/>
    <Column id=tested_model title="Model"/>
    <Column id=tested_column title="Column"/>
    <Column id=failing_rows title="Rows" fmt="#,##0"/>
</DataTable>

Each row above has a table behind it. `select * from` the `audit_table` value to
see the exact rows that failed, instead of reproducing the test by hand.

{:else}

Nothing is failing, which on a green build is the expected state. This section is
not broken: every one of the tests above holds, so every `dbt_test__audit` table
is empty. If one were failing, this table would name it and point at the audit
table holding the offending rows.

{/if}

## What the build costs

The three sections above describe the warehouse. This one describes the *build* —
one row per node per `dbt build`, appended rather than replaced, so it is the one
table on this page that accumulates.

```sql latest_run
select * from warehouse.pipeline_runs
where invocation_id = (
    select invocation_id from warehouse.pipeline_runs
    order by invocation_started_at desc limit 1
)
order by total_s desc
```

```sql run_totals
select
    count(distinct invocation_id)                        as invocations,
    sum(node_count) filter (where invocation_id = (
        select invocation_id from warehouse.pipeline_runs
        order by invocation_started_at desc limit 1
    ))                                                   as latest_nodes
from warehouse.pipeline_runs
```

The most recent build ran <Value data={run_totals} column=latest_nodes fmt="#,##0"/> nodes.

<DataTable data={latest_run}>
    <Column id=resource_type title="Node type"/>
    <Column id=node_count title="Nodes" fmt="#,##0"/>
    <Column id=total_s title="Seconds" fmt="#,##0.00" contentType=bar/>
    <Column id=compile_s title="of which compile" fmt="#,##0.00"/>
    <Column id=slowest_node_s title="Slowest node" fmt="#,##0.00"/>
</DataTable>

<Alert status=info>

**So what.** The data-quality layer *is* the build. Tests and unit tests together
cost several times what building every model costs — the price of
`store_failures` being on project-wide and of running unit tests inside
`dbt build` rather than excluding them from production runs. Both are deliberate
and both are argued in the docs; neither had ever been measured.

The seconds do not sum to the per-node total. dbt reports `compile` and
`execute` as named phases and counts work outside both in the figure it calls
execution time, so both are stored rather than one derived from the other.

</Alert>

```sql cost_trend
select
    invocation_started_at,
    resource_type,
    total_s
from warehouse.pipeline_runs
order by invocation_started_at
```

{#if run_totals[0].invocations > 1}

<BarChart
    data={cost_trend}
    x=invocation_started_at
    y=total_s
    series=resource_type
    title="Build cost over time, seconds by node type"
    yFmt="#,##0.00"
/>

{:else}

There is only one build recorded so far, so there is no trend to draw yet. That
is the expected state on a fresh warehouse and in CI, both of which start from an
empty DuckDB file. The history accumulates a row set per `just pipeline-status`
and is carried between published releases by `publish/restore_history.py` — the
same machinery that keeps the snapshot revisions and the weather archive.

{/if}

## Where these numbers come from

None of this is instrumentation added for the purpose. dlt stamps `_dlt_load_id`
on every landing row, dbt stores each failing test row in a `dbt_test__audit`
table, and `information_schema` knows the shape of every layer.
`transform/pipeline_status.py` walks all three into `analytics.pipeline_sources`,
`pipeline_tables` and `pipeline_tests`, because two of them need dynamic SQL over
a variable table list and one needs a file that lives outside the database.

The build cost is that argument once more. dbt has written per-node timings to
`dbt/target/run_results.json` on every invocation since long before anything read
them, and `analytics.pipeline_runs` is that artifact appended to a table. What it
deliberately does not carry is a row count per model: dbt-duckdb returns a bare
`OK` rather than a count for anything but a seed, and the row counts that matter
are two sections up, measured from the warehouse where they are true.
