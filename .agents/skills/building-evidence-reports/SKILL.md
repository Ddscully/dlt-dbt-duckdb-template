# Building Evidence reports

`reports/` is an [Evidence](https://evidence.dev) project: SQL + markdown compile
to a static site. It reads the same DuckDB file as everything else, so the
warehouse must exist first (`just run`).

There is no vendor agent skill for Evidence — this is the repo's own guidance.
The charting traps a page author hits — reserved column names like `tests` and
`rows`, the screenshot budget that fakes the same blank chart, `*_pct` scaling,
years rendering as `2025.0` — are written up in `reports/README.md`.

**Trust the installed components over any hosted doc.** This repo pins Evidence
OSS 40.1.8 (`@evidence-dev/core-components` 5.4.2). The Evidence Studio docs, and
the `evidence-studio` MCP that serves them, describe the cloud, Markdoc-based
product and are wrong here in both directions: they list components that do not
exist in OSS (`treemap`, `pie_chart`, `radar_chart`, …), omit `BoxPlot`, which
does and is used on `findings.md`, and write `{% line_chart … /%}` where pages
here write `<LineChart data={x} yFmt="…"/>`. The MCP was installed once and
removed for exactly that; don't re-add it. Read a component's props in
`reports/node_modules/@evidence-dev/core-components/dist/` (the `.svelte` file)
first, then <https://docs.evidence.dev>, which matches 40.x.

## The one gotcha that will cost you an hour

**`just report` can validate against a stale schema after a column change.** It
has happened here after mart columns were added and dropped: the build checked a
page against the old columns and failed with a missing-column error. Deleting
`reports/.evidence/` fixes it. It is not Evidence's query-hash cache (an md5 of
each source's SQL): `evidence sources` consults that only with `--changed`,
which `package.json` does not pass. So treat `.evidence/` as state that can go
stale.

After any change to mart or analytics columns:

```bash
just report-clean   # rm -rf .evidence build && npm install && npm run sources && npm run build
```

not `just report`. `just report` is only safe when the warehouse schema is
unchanged. **The same goes for a source query's column list**, even when no mart
changed: `just report` kept building against a schema that still declared a
dropped column (`reports/.evidence/template/static/data/…/*.schema.json`). Clear
`.evidence/` rather than reason about what it reuses.

## A source query ships every column it selects

**A `select *` source query ships every column to every visitor**, and grepping
the queries for `customer_id` cannot find one that names no columns. The site's
retail queries select only what their charts draw, which is the site's half of
the personal-data policy; the release's half is `publishing-a-release`.

## A source query must return rows

A source that comes back empty is written as a 0-byte parquet and the *build*
fails on it: `Invalid Input Error: File 'warehouse_x.parquet' too small to be a
Parquet file`. So don't put the interesting filter in the source — select the
whole table there and filter in the page's own SQL block, where an empty result
is fine (components render their empty state). `co2_estimate_versions.sql` is
the example: unfiltered source, `where is_revised` on the page.

Pair that with an explicit empty branch when the table can legitimately be
empty:

````markdown
{#if biggest.length > 0}
<DataTable data={biggest}/>
{:else}
Nothing recorded yet — and here's why that's expected.
{/if}
````

## A page query may not read another page query

**Query chaining does not work here, and the half that fails silently is the
chart half.** Writing `from <name-of-an-earlier-block>` in a SQL block looks like
it should work — the blocks are named and later ones are compiled after earlier
ones — and it resolves to nothing at all:

| Chained block feeds | Build log | Built HTML | In a browser |
|---|---|---|---|
| `<Value>` (prerendered) | `Error in Query! Catalog Error: Table with name X does not exist!` | carries the error | `Loading...` forever |
| `<BarChart>`, `<DataTable>` | **nothing** | carries the error | a grey skeleton box, forever |

The build exits 0 and writes the page either way, so a chart built this way is a
page that deploys, passes `site_pages_all_rendered` (the HTML is full size) and
renders an empty box. Only the grep in *Verify a build actually succeeded* below
and an actual browser can see it — which is why that grep is worth running even
when the build log is clean. Measured with a scratch page carrying one chained
query per component type.

**The fix is a source query, not a longer block.** Move the shared computation
into `sources/warehouse/<name>.sql` and have every block read it. That is what
`weather_price_pairs.sql` is: the year-over-year join the weather page needs in
six places, computed once. It is also faster — the window functions run at build
time rather than in every visitor's browser — and it puts the SQL somewhere
`build_report.page_tables()` can see, so the exposure test covers it.

## How it's wired

| Path | Role |
|---|---|
| `sources/warehouse/connection.yaml` | DuckDB source → `../data/warehouse.duckdb` |
| `sources/warehouse/*.sql` | One file per source query; the filename is the reference name |
| `pages/*.md` | One page each; frontmatter title + SQL blocks + components |

A file at `sources/warehouse/emissions_energy.sql` is referenced in pages as
`warehouse.emissions_energy`. Adding a new source query means adding a `.sql`
file there, then `npm run sources`.

### Pointing a build at a different warehouse

`connection.yaml`'s `filename` is not the last word: Evidence merges
`EVIDENCE_SOURCE__<source>__<option>` over it, so
`EVIDENCE_SOURCE__warehouse__filename` redirects a build without touching the
committed file. That is the lever a scratch-warehouse build needs — see
[`docs/RUNNING_AS_A_SERVICE.md`](../../../docs/RUNNING_AS_A_SERVICE.md).

**It must be relative to `sources/warehouse/`, and an absolute path fails in the
worst way.** The DuckDB connector resolves it with `path.join(sourceDirectory,
filename)`, and `path.join` does not respect a leading slash — so an absolute
path like `/srv/scratch/warehouse.duckdb` is opened with its leading slash eaten
and the source directory pasted on the front, and the error names a path nobody
typed. (Spelling that joined path out in full here is what the citation guard in
`tests/test_course.py` reads as a claim that it exists, which is why it is
described rather than quoted.) Same shape as the `LAKEHOUSE_DIR` trap, one layer
out. Verify
a redirect by pointing it at an *empty* database rather than a missing one: every
query then fails with `Table … does not exist`, which proves the extraction read
somewhere else, where a missing file only proves it tried.

The connector opens the file `READ_ONLY`, so a site build never takes the writer
lock — but it is still a *reader*, and a build holding the warehouse read-write
locks it out entirely (`querying-the-warehouse` has the measured table).

## Writing a page

SQL blocks are named and become queryable results:

````markdown
```sql renew_vs_life
select country_iso3, renewables_share_pct, life_expectancy
from warehouse.emissions_energy
where year = ${inputs.year.value}
```

<ScatterPlot data={renew_vs_life} x=renewables_share_pct y=life_expectancy/>
````

- Inputs interpolate as `${inputs.<name>.value}` — see the `<Dropdown>` year
  selector at the top of `pages/index.md`. Use `.value` inside SQL (it's a SQL
  fragment) and `{inputs.<name>.label}` in prose; `.value` in prose renders the
  raw fragment. `<Value data={q} column=year/>` is *not* a substitute — it shows
  the first row of that query, not the selection, so it silently disagrees with
  the charts as soon as the user picks another year.
- **`<Alert>` needs blank lines around its content.** It's the callout component
  (`findings.md` uses it for the "So what" boxes) and takes
  `status="base|info|positive|warning|negative"` — the older `default`/`danger`/
  `success` spellings still render but log a deprecation warning. Written tight
  against the tags, the markdown inside comes out literal (`**text**`):

  ````markdown
  <Alert status=info>

  **So what.** Body text, which may span paragraphs.

  </Alert>
  ````

  It isn't in the components list most Evidence docs pages show; the exhaustive
  answer is `ls reports/node_modules/@evidence-dev/core-components/dist/{atoms,molecules,organisms,unsorted/ui}`.
- **`<Dropdown defaultValue>` must be braced if the values are numbers.**
  `defaultValue=2024` is the *string* `"2024"`; DuckDB hands the options back as
  doubles (`2024.0`), the strict-equality match fails, and no option is selected.
  Nothing errors: `inputs.year.value` stays at Evidence's
  `(SELECT NULL WHERE 0 /* An Input has not been set */)` sentinel, so every
  query filtering on it sits at `Loading...` forever while input-free charts on
  the same page render normally. Write `defaultValue={2024}`.
- **Same cause, second symptom: a year cast to a string on a page renders
  `2025.0`.** The extractor writes every numeric column to parquet as `DOUBLE`,
  and page SQL runs in the browser against that — so `cast(year as varchar)`
  stringifies a double. It's a string by then, so no `fmt` fixes it. Where the
  value stays numeric (DataTable column, `<BigValue>`) leave it alone and pass
  `fmt="0"`; where it has to be text (a chart's category axis) write
  `cast(cast(year as integer) as varchar)`. A *source* query is server-side and
  needs neither, which is why `latest_years.sql`'s `*_label` columns look
  simpler than they can be on a page.
- **A paragraph that *starts* with a component isn't wrapped in `<p>`**, so it
  renders with no margin against the paragraph below it. Lead with a word
  (`In total <Value .../> lines, …`). Only paragraph-initial components matter:
  a component beginning a wrapped line *inside* a paragraph is fine, and
  `findings.md` relies on that.
- **`agg=` on `<Value>` renders the right number and logs two failed queries
  per use.** `<Value data={q} column=n agg=sum/>` prints the correct total — it
  falls back to aggregating the rows it already has — while the build log gains
  `Error in Query! Parser Error: SELECT clause without selection list` twice,
  and `evidence build` still exits 0. Bisected: the same page with the same SQL
  blocks, the same `<DataTable contentType=bar>` and the same `<BarChart>` and
  no `agg=` builds silently. It is another prop the hosted docs describe and
  this OSS version does not implement — see *Trust the installed components*,
  at the top, for why the docs disagree with the build. **Aggregate in the query instead**,
  which also prerenders the number server-side. The reason to care about a
  working component is the log: two permanent errors in every build are what a
  real one then hides in.
- **`<Value>` emits a trailing space, so never put punctuation straight after
  one.** `<Value .../>.` renders as "Turkmenistan ." and `<Value .../>'s` as
  "Norway 's". End the clause on words instead: `... at <Value .../> g/kWh.`
- **Keep a sentence containing a `<Value>` on one source line.** A wrapped
  paragraph that has a component in it stops processing markdown at the wrap, so
  a `[link](/foo)` later in the same paragraph renders as literal brackets. Long
  lines are the price; a following paragraph with no component is unaffected.
  - **It is every mark, not just links** — `**bold**` and `` `code` `` go
    literal the same way, and the asymmetry inside one paragraph is what makes
    it hard to see: `currency.md`'s staleness alert opens with `**…**` that
    renders as `<strong>` and closes, four wrapped lines later, with marks that
    do not. Same block, same syntax, different treatment, no error.
  - **Inside an `<Alert>` it is easier to miss again**, because the callout
    still looks deliberate — a reader reads stray asterisks as typing rather
    than as a build fault, and nothing appears in the build log.
  - **The fix when the paragraph must wrap is a second paragraph with no
    component in it**, which processes normally. That is where to put a flag or
    column name you want in code marks. Confirmed by render, not by reading:
    the split sentence comes back as `<code class="markdown">`.
- Don't hardcode the upper bound of a year selector (`where year between 1990
  and 2022`) — it silently pins the dashboard to whatever year the warehouse
  held the day it was written. `where year >= 1990` tracks the data.
- Charts and `<BigValue>` need explicit `fmt=` for anything that isn't a plain
  number; percentages in this warehouse are stored 0–100, so `fmt='0.0"%"'`, not
  a percent format that multiplies by 100.
- **`sort` on a chart means two different things, and the year cast above flips
  which one you get.** `_Chart.svelte` sorts by *x* when the x column is a value
  or a time, and by **y, descending** when it is a category. So
  `cast(cast(year as integer) as varchar)` — the fix for the `2,024` symptom
  above — turns the axis into a category and silently reorders it by value: a
  correlation-by-year bar chart came out `2020 2018 2014 2019 …`, which reads as
  a rendering glitch rather than a sort. Pass `sort=false` on any chart whose x
  is a cast year, and let the query's `order by` stand.
- **A literal `+` in a format string is not a sign.** `fmt='+0.0"%"'` on a column
  that holds negatives renders them `-+18.2%`, because the `+` is copied through
  as text rather than being read as a positive-sign directive. Use `'0.0"%"'` and
  let the minus speak; a signed column reads fine without a plus on the positives.
- **A `*_pct` column with no explicit format is multiplied by 100.** Evidence
  infers a format from the column *name*: `lookupColumnFormat` takes everything
  after the last underscore and matches it against the built-in format tags, and
  `pct` assumes a fraction. Every chart here happens to be safe because every
  chart passes an explicit format — the bug surfaces on the parts you didn't
  think needed one, like a `<Heatmap>`'s color legend (`retail.md` shipped one
  reading `263%`–`3,757%` for a 2.63–37.57 column). Pass `valueFmt` /
  `fmt` / `yFmt` on anything rendering a `*_pct` column. `id`, `fract`, `mult`,
  `sci`, `num0`–`num4` and the date tags are live suffixes too; currency ones
  are not.
- Filter nulls in the SQL. `electricity_price_eur_kwh` is null outside the
  EU/EEA and `life_expectancy` is sparse in early years — unfiltered they render
  as gaps or drag averages.

## Verify a build actually succeeded

Evidence exits 0 on some failures and writes the error into the page, so check
the output rather than the exit code:

```bash
just report-clean
grep -oiE '(could not|error|does not exist|no such|binder error|catalog error)[^<]{0,60}' reports/build/index.html
```

Empty output means clean — but **`error: null` is a false positive on every
page**, including ones you didn't touch: it's a field in SvelteKit's embedded
data payload. Diff against a page you didn't change before believing any hit. Then confirm the numbers look sane — a formatting bug
shows up as absurd percentages:

```bash
grep -rho '"[0-9]\{3,\}%"\|[0-9]\{1,\},[0-9]\{3\}%' reports/build/
```

### Text dumps can't tell working from broken

**`Loading...` in the built HTML is normal.** Evidence prerenders the page shell
and fetches results client-side (DuckDB-WASM reading the parquet in
`build/data/`), so `curl`, `grep` and any headless dump of the *text* show
`Loading...` for every component whether or not the page works. Only a browser
that runs JS can tell you.

To actually look at the page:

```bash
cd reports && npm run preview            # serves build/ on :3000 with range support
chromium --headless=old --no-sandbox --disable-gpu --window-size=1400,2100 \
  --virtual-time-budget=60000 --screenshot=/tmp/page.png http://localhost:3000/
```

- **Snap chromium can only write the screenshot under a non-hidden `$HOME`
  path.** `--screenshot=/tmp/...` fails `No such file or directory` and
  `$HOME/.cache/...` fails `Permission denied`, both from confinement rather than
  from the flag — so the scratchpad directory is not usable here. `~/shots/` is
  where this repo's page screenshots have accumulated; use it.
- Use `--headless=old`. On this machine snap chromium's *new* headless mode
  silently produces nothing — no DOM, no screenshot, no stderr, exit 0. Same for
  `--dump-dom` and `--enable-logging=stderr` in either mode.
- `python3 -m http.server` is not good enough for `build/`; it has no Range
  support, which DuckDB-WASM needs for the parquet.
- **The 60 s budget is load-bearing on a long page, and cutting it fakes a bug.**
  At 25 s, a page with three charts screenshots with one of them showing its axis,
  its categories and its value labels and *no bars* — a different chart on each
  run, which reads exactly like the reserved-column-name failure and sends you
  editing SQL that was fine. Shoot twice before believing a chart is broken: a
  real failure hits the same chart every time.
- For console errors and failed requests, drive it over CDP instead: launch with
  `--remote-debugging-port=9222`, then connect from a Node script (Node 22 has a
  global `WebSocket`) and subscribe to `Runtime.consoleAPICalled`,
  `Runtime.exceptionThrown` and `Network.loadingFailed`.
- `build/api/prerendered_queries/*.arrow` holds the build-time results — reading
  their row counts with `pyarrow` tells you which queries produced data and which
  came back empty, without a browser at all.

## Node, not uv

This is the one layer that isn't Python. It needs Node; `npm install` runs from
`reports/`. `reports/node_modules/` and `reports/build/` are gitignored, as is
`reports/.evidence/`.

## Where the site meets the asset graph

Three facts that lived in `AGENTS.md`'s *Orchestration* section until they were
filed here, because all three are about the site rather than about Dagster.

- **The site's deps are one per table it reads, not the single ordering edge.**
  `publish.build_report.TABLE_TO_DBT_MODEL` / `TABLE_TO_ASSET_KEY` map the 20
  tables the source queries read to the assets that write them, and
  `tests/test_report.py` parses `reports/sources/**/*.sql` and fails if the two
  disagree. Without it, adding a source query on a new mart would leave the site
  building from a stale copy of it while the graph still showed complete lineage —
  no error, just an old number. The maps live in `publish/` rather than beside the
  asset because `just test` runs before `dbt parse` in CI and so can't import
  anything that needs the dbt manifest.
- **`site_pages_all_rendered` is blocking, and it checks file *size*.**
  `evidence build` exits 0 for a site missing a page, and nothing downstream reads
  `reports/build/` — so a route that emitted only the SvelteKit shell would
  materialise green and deploy. The eleven pages render at 19–92 kB; the floor is
  8 kB. The two smallest are the ones carrying the least SQL — the routing front
  page (19 kB) and Restatements (20 kB) — so it is prose-only pages, not chart
  pages, that would ever bring the floor into play.
- **`explore`, `settings` and `api` are reserved route names.** Evidence's own
  template ships `pages/explore/` (the SQL console and schema browser) and
  `pages/settings/`, so an `explore.md` added under `reports/pages/` is silently *not* copied into
  `.evidence/template/src/pages/` and the build dies on
  `Internal Error /api/[...route]/evidencemeta.json … /api/explore/… status 500`
  — a message that names neither the page nor the collision. `just report-clean`
  does not help, because nothing is stale. The country explorer is
  `pages/countries.md` for exactly this reason.
