# Adding a data source

Adding a source touches five layers that are wired together by **name**, not by
imports. Miss one and the pipeline still runs — it just quietly splits into two
disconnected halves. Work the checklist top to bottom.

The `dbt` vendor plugin covers the *how* of dbt, and is the only vendor skill
still enabled — `dagster-expert`, `polars` and `duckdb-skills` were all retired
on measured zero use, so the tool-level knowledge for those layers is the
project skills and `AGENTS.md`. This skill covers the *seams between the
layers*, which are specific to this repo. Naming rules live in [`docs/STYLE_GUIDE.md`](../../../docs/STYLE_GUIDE.md).

## 0. First decide whether you need a new source at all

If the data is another World Bank indicator, you do **not** need a new resource —
see "Adding a WDI indicator" at the bottom. That's a two-line change.

## 1. dlt resource — `ingest/sources/<source>.py`

**One module per upstream source**, holding its own constants, URL builders,
watermark helpers and `@dlt.resource`. A genuinely new publisher gets a new
module; a second resource from a publisher already here joins that module (the
World Bank has two, the country dimension and the WDI panel).

**The four coordination tuples stay in `ingest/pipeline.py` and are deliberately
not per-source metadata.** `PARTITIONED_RESOURCES` carries a comment arguing the
rule across all four candidates at once — why `ecb_fx_rates` merges and is still
not partitioned, why retail's *load* narrows when its fetch cannot. Scattering
those onto six modules would file each half of a comparison somewhere it cannot
be read against the other half.

- The `name=` you pick becomes the raw table name **and** the second element of
  the Dagster asset key (`raw/<resource>`). Choose it once and don't rename it
  casually — step 4 explains what breaks.
- **CSV sources:** `pl.read_csv(..., infer_schema_length=None)`. The default
  100-row inference sees OWID's empty early rows and lands numerics as VARCHAR.
- **Leave `REFRESH = "drop_resources"` alone.** dlt persists its schema and only
  *widens* types, so a column that lands wrong is not fixed by re-running. It's
  `drop_resources` and not `drop_sources` because Dagster can materialize a
  subset — `drop_sources` would wipe the tables that weren't selected.
- **`replace` is the default answer.** These sources are small and a full reload
  keeps the schema honest. Reach for `merge` only when the pull is genuinely
  expensive, and then copy `wb_wdi` wholesale: a primary key that really is the
  grain, declared `columns={...}` types (the schema is no longer re-inferred, so
  inference can't save you), a *lookback window* rather than a high-water mark if
  the publisher restates, and the name in `INCREMENTAL_RESOURCES` so it loads in
  the un-refreshed call.
- **Four resources `replace` and four `merge`, so a load is two `run()`s.**
  `refresh` is an argument to `run()`, not a property of a resource, and it would
  drop a merge table and its watermark. `load_groups()` returns the replace group
  with `REFRESH` and the merge group without, restricted to the resources
  selected.
- **dlt state is keyed on the pipeline *name*, not the destination**, so a
  fixture run would hand its watermarks to the next real run. `build_pipeline()`
  appends `_fixtures` to the name under `INGEST_FIXTURES=1`. (dlt resets state
  when the destination is empty, so this bites only once a real landing zone
  exists.)
- **A resource that yields Arrow gets no `_dlt_load_id` unless you ask** —
  `build_pipeline()` sets `NORMALIZE__PARQUET_NORMALIZER__ADD_DLT_LOAD_ID=true`,
  or the retail table lands with no load provenance and freshness and
  `pipeline_sources` silently skip it. Adding the column to an existing table
  needs a `drop table` plus `refresh="drop_resources"`.
- **`.arrow()` is a streaming reader with a 1,000,000-row default batch**; handed
  to dlt as a table it stored exactly 1,000,000 of 1,067,371 rows, with no error.
  `to_arrow_reader(RETAIL_BATCH_ROWS)` and `yield from` is the fix, and
  `test_retail_yields_every_row_the_workbook_holds` counts.
- **Declare `timezone: False` on a timestamp column**, or dlt makes it
  `TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE` and a 07:45 till time reads `08:45:00+01:00` on a CET
  machine.

Run `just ingest` and look at the real column names before writing any SQL:

```bash
uv run python -c "
from lake.lakehouse import read_only_connection
print(read_only_connection().sql(\"select column_name, data_type from information_schema.columns \
  where table_schema='raw' and table_name='<resource>'\"))"
```

**Ask the catalog, not `data/warehouse.duckdb`.** dlt lands `raw` in the DuckLake
catalog, so the same query against the warehouse file returns zero rows with no
error — an empty answer that reads as "no such columns". `just sql` attaches the
catalog, so `lakehouse.raw.<resource>` works there too.

dlt snake_cases and flattens nested JSON: `iso2Code` → `iso2_code`,
`incomeLevel.value` → `income_level__value`. Never guess these.

## 2. dbt source — `dbt/models/staging/_sources.yml`

Add the table under the `raw` source. **The `name:` here must equal the dlt
resource name from step 1.**

## 3. Staging model — `dbt/models/staging/stg_<thing>.sql`

Cleans to the project grain, `(country_iso3, year)`:

- Rename the source's key columns to `country_iso3` and `year`. Every model in
  the warehouse joins on those two and nothing else.
- Drop non-country aggregates. The `stg_co2` pattern is
  `where iso_code is not null and length(iso_code) = 3`.
- If the source is keyed by ISO2, join `stg_country` to get ISO3. Watch for
  non-standard codes — Eurostat sends `EL` for Greece and `UK` for the UK, and
  `stg_eu_electricity_prices.sql` remaps both.
- Import CTEs at the top, one `{{ source() }}` or `{{ ref() }}` each.
- Add the model to the staging YAML with a description that states the grain and
  any partial coverage.

Run `just lint` — the style rules are enforced, not advisory.

## 4. Dagster asset key — usually nothing to do, but verify

`RawSchemaDltTranslator` in `orchestration/assets.py` keys every dlt resource as
`raw/<resource>`, which is exactly the key `dagster-dbt` derives from
`_sources.yml`. That matching string is the *only* thing joining the EL half of
the graph to the T half.

So: **if step 1's resource name and step 2's source name agree, the graph wires
itself.** If they don't, both halves still materialize — unconnected — and no
error is raised. Always verify:

```bash
uv run --group orchestration dagster definitions validate
```

then open `just dagster` and confirm the new asset has an edge into `staging`.

**The mart is versioned**, so the file is `_v2.sql` while the relation stays
`marts.fct_emissions_energy` (v2 is aliased back to the bare name). You do not
need to touch v1: it is a `select * exclude (…)` view over v2 and its contract is
declared `include: all`, so a new column reaches both on its own — which also
means it ships to v1's consumers without a second decision.

Add an import CTE, a `left join` on `(country_iso3, year)`, and the column in the
right source group with a `--` comment. The left joins hang off
`dim_country_year`, the spine — so coverage wider than the other sources' survives
— but **add your staging model to the `observed` CTE as well**, or the mart keeps
only the country-years the existing four report and your extra rows are filtered
out before you see them.

Update the mart yml for your model's dbt group — `dbt/models/marts/` holds one
per group (`_country_stats.yml`, `_reference.yml`, `_compliance.yml`,
`_retail.yml`) — then `just dbt-build`. Note the partial
coverage in the column's YAML description either way — that's the convention.

## 6. Downstream

- **Evidence** (`reports/`) — new mart columns need
  `just report-clean`, not `just report`: after a column change `just report`
  can validate against a stale schema under `reports/.evidence/` (see
  `building-evidence-reports`).
- **Docs** — the source table belongs in the `raw` list in `AGENTS.md` and the
  "Data sources" section of `README.md`.

## Verify before you call it done

```bash
just run   # ingest -> dbt build -> transform, against the real APIs
uv run python -c "import duckdb; \
  print(duckdb.connect('data/warehouse.duckdb', read_only=True).sql(\
  'select * from marts.fct_emissions_energy limit 5'))"
```

Check the row count didn't drop and the new column isn't all-null. Don't assume.

## Adding a WDI indicator

Two places, both required:

Then the mart column (step 5) and the report (step 6). The
`wdi_indicators_all_present` asset check will fail if the API returns 200 with an
empty series for the new code, which is the common failure mode.

`wb_wdi` is loaded incrementally, but the watermarks are kept **per indicator**,
so a code that isn't in the state yet is fetched in full — you get the whole
series, not the last five years. Nothing to do about it beyond re-recording the
fixtures (`just record-fixtures`), which the offline tests need anyway.
