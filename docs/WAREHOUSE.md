# The warehouse

What the pipeline loads, how it's laid out, and the Parquet archive beside it.
The [README](../README.md) has the short version.

## Data sources

Seven feeds from five publishers, all freely licensed and small enough to run
locally. Six are country-keyed; the seventh isn't a country dataset at all. The
CBAM default values are an eighth source that arrives as a seed instead of a
feed, for the reasons in
[the `compliance-models` skill](../.agents/skills/compliance-models/SKILL.md).

| Dataset | Grain | Link |
|---------|-------|------|
| OWID CO₂ & GHG | country-year (fact) | https://github.com/owid/co2-data |
| OWID Energy | country-year (fact) | https://github.com/owid/energy-data |
| World Bank WDI: GDP, life expectancy, population, poverty | country-year (fact) | https://databank.worldbank.org/source/world-development-indicators |
| World Bank countries: region & income group | country (dimension) | https://api.worldbank.org/v2/country?format=json |
| Eurostat: household electricity prices (EU/EEA) | country-half-year (fact) | https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/nrg_pc_204 |
| ECB euro reference rates, via Frankfurter | date-currency (fact), the first sub-annual grain | https://frankfurter.dev |
| UCI Online Retail II: one retailer's invoice lines | invoice-line (fact), the finest grain here and the only one below a country | https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/502/online+retail+ii |

Joins are on **ISO country code + year**, yielding marts like *"CO₂ per \$ of GDP
by income group over time"* and *"renewables adoption vs. life expectancy."*

The sources don't agree on coverage. The fact is therefore built on an explicit
country-year spine (`dim_country_year`) instead of off whichever source happens
to be widest, so a country-year that only Eurostat or only the World Bank reports
still lands, carrying nulls in the columns the others don't fill.

### Three sources keep a finer grain of their own

Eurostat publishes half-yearly. `fct_eu_electricity_prices_semiannual` holds the
published halves alongside the annual average that joins to everything else.
Averaging is what the annual grain costs, and it costs a lot: half-over-half
price moves averaged 19% across countries in 2022 against 3–4% through the 2010s.
Both grains are in the warehouse for that reason.

The ECB's series is daily and has no country in it at all, which is what forced
the warehouse's first calendar (`dim_date`), its first gap-filling decision and
its first `materialized='incremental'` model. See the
[Currency page](https://ddscully.github.io/dlt-dbt-duckdb-evidence/currency).

The retailer's grain is a single invoice line at a timestamp, below a country
rather than beside one, and it's the only source here that isn't a statistical
publication. Nothing about it has been cleaned by anyone, so the modelling is the
value: what counts as a return, which rows are revenue, and who the customer is
when 22.8% of lines have no id. See the
[Retail page](https://ddscully.github.io/dlt-dbt-duckdb-evidence/retail).

### Two write dispositions, two load calls

Four of the seven resources load with dlt's `replace` disposition: both OWID
files, the World Bank country list and Eurostat prices. They're small enough that
a full reload every run is the honest default, and it keeps dlt re-inferring the
schema so an upstream type change fails loudly.

The other three are incremental. WDI is the biggest pull (~190k rows across 11
indicators) and loads with `merge` on `(indicator, country_iso3, year)` over a
five-year window. That window is a lookback and not "everything newer than last
time", because the World Bank restates years it has already published.

The two dispositions need two `run()` calls. `refresh` is a property of a run, so
refreshing the replace tables in the same call would drop the incremental ones'
history along with their watermarks. `load_groups()` in `ingest/pipeline.py` is
what both `main()` and the Dagster assets iterate.

A restatement older than the window doesn't need the whole series pulled again.
WDI is partitioned by year in the asset graph, so `just backfill-wdi 1997`
re-fetches that year and merges it in.

## Schemas

Two files. dlt lands `raw` in the DuckLake catalog under `data/lakehouse/`, and
everything built from it is in the DuckDB file, `data/warehouse.duckdb` — so the
file alone holds no `raw`, and its `staging` views need the catalog attached as
`lakehouse` (which `just sql` does):

| Schema | Written by | Contents |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| `raw` | dlt, into the lakehouse | landed source tables (`owid_co2`, `owid_energy`, `wb_country`, `wb_wdi`, `eu_elec_prices`, `ecb_fx_rates`, `retail_invoice_lines`, `om_weather_daily`). `om_weather_daily` is carried between releases rather than refetched, because a rebuild would cost days of Open-Meteo's daily budget |
| `staging` | dbt (views) | cleaned 1:1 models (`stg_*`) at `(country_iso3, year)` grain, except `stg_eu_electricity_prices_semiannual` (Eurostat's half-years), `stg_fx_rates` (`(rate_date, currency_code)`), `stg_retail_lines` (`(invoice, line_number)`) and `stg_weather_daily` (`(country_iso3, weather_date)`) |
| `intermediate` | dbt (views) | `int_*`, the derivations two models share or one model should be tested apart from: `int_country_year_observed` (the country-years the four country-stats sources report, read by both the spine and the wide fact), `int_cbam_default_factors` (Annex I's row-level fallback rule) and `int_retail_return_matches` (the returns-to-purchase inference). `private`, uncontracted, and not published as Parquet |
| `marts` | dbt (tables) | `dim_country`, the conformed country dimension — one row per `country_iso3`, and what every country key in the warehouse joins to; `dim_country_year`, that crossed with the years to make the country-year spine; `fct_emissions_energy`, the wide joined fact; `dim_grid_emission_factors`, grid factors packaged as a Scope 2 reference table; `fct_co2_estimate_versions`, revision history; `dim_country_income_history`, the World Bank income classification as it stood in each year rather than today's stamped onto every year; `fct_country_weather_year`, capital-city weather aggregated to `(country_iso3, year)` for the 41 countries Eurostat prices; `fct_eu_electricity_prices_semiannual`, EU prices at their published half-year grain; `fct_example_scope2_emissions`, the worked example over twelve invented sites; `fct_cbam_exposure`, the CBAM border cost per tonne by sourcing country; the FX and calendar tables (`dim_date`, `dim_currency`, `fct_fx_rates_*`); and the five retail models (`fct_retail_order_line`, `dim_retail_product`, `dim_retail_customer`, `fct_retail_returns`, `fct_retail_customer_cohorts`) |
| `history` | dbt (snapshots) | `snap_co2_estimates` and `snap_grid_emission_factors`, SCD2 versions of OWID's CO₂ numbers and of the Scope 2 factors. Two of the three tables no rebuild can reproduce |
| `analytics` | Polars | derived metrics (`co2_intensity`, `retail_rfm`) and the `pipeline_*` observability tables, of which `pipeline_runs` is appended rather than replaced and is the third unreproducible table |

The country-year spine is the dominant grain but not a house rule.
`fct_cbam_exposure` has no year in it (a regulatory schedule, not a time series),
the FX tables have no country, and the five retail models sit below country
grain.

The country dimension itself is `marts.dim_country` — 228 rows, published, and
`reference`-group because every domain joins to it. `staging.stg_country` is its
cleaning model and not the dimension: two staging peers read it for the capital
coordinates and the ISO2 map, which is the whole of why it is `protected`.

Below country grain is not outside it. `fct_retail_order_line`,
`fct_retail_returns`, `dim_retail_customer` and `analytics.retail_rfm` all carry
`country_iso3` beside the source's own country label, resolved once in
`stg_retail_lines` through the `retail_country_map` seed — so retail revenue can
be grouped by `region` or `income_group`, or put beside the electricity price
its market pays. The source spells nine of its 43 country labels in ways the
dimension does not (`EIRE`, `RSA`, `USA`, `Korea`, `Czech Republic`,
`Hong Kong`, and three that are not countries at all), which is why the
resolution is a seed rather than a join on name.

### What "mart" means, and two refactors measured against

**"Mart" means the subject area, not the file.** There are four marts — the
groups in `dbt/models/_groups.yml` — and the relations in the `marts/` layer are
**mart models**. Counting models and calling them marts is how a stale count once
survived two additions to the layer. `+group:` is set on the folder in
`dbt_project.yml`, and `+schema: marts` on all four, so relation names, the
release layout and the asset keys ignore the nesting.

- **Consolidating models was measured against.** Pairs that share a grain are
  sparse against each other — `fct_retail_returns` is 18,286 rows against
  `fct_retail_order_line`'s 1,067,371, and `fct_country_weather_year` covers 41
  countries against 228 — so merging means columns null on nearly every row. One
  fact table per business *process*, not per grain.
- **Country attributes stay on the facts.** Normalising `country_name`, `region`
  and `income_group` out to `dim_country` would save 0.4% of
  `fct_emissions_energy`'s Parquet, because zstd dictionary-encodes 228 repeated
  strings to nearly nothing, and no copy can drift, since every one is built from
  the dimension in the same run. It would cost eight pages, two source queries
  and a transform a join each, plus a v3 of the versioned model. Kimball's rule is
  a row-store storage argument.
- **The near-miss is `fct_fx_rates_published`**, a strict subset of
  `fct_fx_rates_daily` (`where is_published_rate`). It stays a mart model as the
  only incremental model and a direct site input, but is arguably an
  intermediate concern.

## The bus matrix

Business processes down, conformed dimensions across — Kimball's planning
artifact, and the one thing `_groups.yml` (who owns it), `_exposures.yml` (who
reads it) and the contracts (what shape it is) do not say. **It is derived from
`manifest.json`, never written**: the grain comes from each model's own
uniqueness tests and the columns from its enforced contract, so a mart added
without a conformed key shows up as a hole rather than as nothing.

Two rules decide what a mark means. A uniqueness test carrying a `where` is not
a grain — `dim_grid_emission_factors` asserts one row per country *where
`is_latest_available`*, and reading that as a grain would make a country-year
reference table look like a conformed country dimension. And conformance is
**exact column-name matching**, deliberately: an alias list would have rendered
the FX models' two spellings of the currency key as a tidy row of marks, and
those marks were the defect. On its first render `fct_fx_rates_periods`
conformed to **nothing** and `fct_fx_rates_published` only to `dim_date`, both
because they said `quote_currency` where `dim_currency` publishes
`currency_code`; `fct_retail_returns` was missing `date_key` while
`fct_retail_order_line`, at the identical grain, carried it. All three were
closed on 2026-09-08 — the table is what found them, and an alias list would
have hidden two of them permanently.

## The lakehouse: `data/lakehouse/`

**This is where `raw` lives.** dlt lands the eight source tables into a
[DuckLake](https://ducklake.select) catalog — plain Parquet under
`data/lakehouse/data/`, plus a catalog database holding schema, snapshot lineage
and per-file statistics. dbt attaches it and builds `staging`,
`intermediate`, `marts` and `history` into `data/warehouse.duckdb`, which is the only thing the release
publishes. `just lakehouse` reports what the catalog holds; `just ingest` fills
it.

```sql
install ducklake; load ducklake;
attach 'ducklake:duckdb:data/lakehouse/catalog.duckdb' as lakehouse
    (data_path 'data/lakehouse/data/');

select count(*) from lakehouse.raw.om_weather_daily;
```

There used to be a hive-partitioned archive beside this at `data/lake/`, written
by hand from the warehouse. It is gone: it was a second copy of data DuckLake
already stores as Parquet, and keeping both meant maintaining two answers to
*what moved upstream?*.

- **Ask what changed by diffing two snapshots, not with the change feed.**
  `ducklake_table_changes()` is the obvious tool and it does not survive dlt,
  which regenerates `_dlt_id` and `_dlt_load_id` on every row it re-merges —
  reloading 500 identical rows reports 500 `update_preimage`/`update_postimage`
  pairs. The feed is right; the writer makes it meaningless. So:

```python
from lake.lakehouse import WEATHER_TABLE, revisions, versions

v = versions(WEATHER_TABLE)              # snapshots in which this table changed
revisions(WEATHER_TABLE, v[-2], v[-1])   # rows that genuinely differ
```

  which projects the provenance columns away and returns **0 rows** for a no-op
  reload and exactly the changed rows for a real restatement. It also works
  between *any* two snapshots, so "what changed since last month" is one query.

- **No partition column, and none needed.** DuckLake prunes on catalog
  statistics, so a filter still reads one file with no directory layout to
  arrange it. `raw.om_weather_daily` is keyed on `weather_date` and has no `year`
  column — the hive archive would have needed one invented for the layout.
- **The catalog is not optional.** `read_parquet` over `data/lakehouse/data/`
  will not give you the table: DuckLake writes positional delete files that only
  the catalog applies, so a glob either fails on a schema mismatch or returns
  superseded rows alongside current ones.
- **Deleting `data/lakehouse/` is the destructive act in this repo now.** It is
  the only copy of every landing table, and it holds both the snapshot lineage
  (which no rebuild invents) and the capital-city weather archive (which no
  rebuild can afford — days of Open-Meteo's daily budget). `just clean` does not
  list it.

Weather is the table worth diffing because it is the only source here that
restates on a schedule — Open-Meteo serves preliminary ERA5T and Copernicus
supersedes it with final ERA5 two to three months later, so every ingest
re-merges 90 days of daily rows in place.
