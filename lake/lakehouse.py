"""The lakehouse: where dlt lands `raw`, and how to read what changed.

dlt writes straight into this DuckLake catalog, dbt reads `raw` from it, and
`data/warehouse.duckdb` holds only what dbt builds.

Run:  uv run python -m lake.lakehouse       (report the catalog's snapshots)

## Reading what changed

`ducklake_table_changes()` is useless behind dlt: dlt regenerates `_dlt_id` and
`_dlt_load_id` on every row it re-merges, so reloading 500 identical rows reports
500 updates. `revisions()` diffs two snapshots with `EXCEPT` instead, projecting
those columns away — measured at 0 rows for an identical reload and 1 for a
one-row change. It works between any two snapshots and needs no bookkeeping, so
a consumer can re-derive it from the published catalog. The cost is two scans.

## Why the working paths are absolute

A DuckLake catalog stores its `data_path` as given. The working catalog is read
by dlt from the repo root and by dbt from `dbt/`, so its path must be absolute
(`just` exports an absolute `LAKEHOUSE_DIR`). The published one in
`lakehouse.tar.gz` is relative, so a consumer can unpack it anywhere and open it
with a bare `ATTACH`. The measurements are in the `the-lakehouse` skill.
