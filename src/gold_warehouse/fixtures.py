"""Serve recorded payloads instead of live endpoints, behind the same code path.

An ingest layer that fetches from live APIs makes CI a test of whether those APIs
happen to be up, which is not what a pull request is asking. This is the shim:
one environment variable swaps every fetch for a checked-in file, so the *whole*
pipeline — schema inference, dbt, the transforms, the checks — runs offline and
deterministically.

Two things hold it up, and both are easy to give away:

* **Fixtures sit behind the same code path, not beside it.** Record the payload
  in the format the endpoint actually serves (gzipped CSV, the raw JSON body) so
  the parsing gotchas that bite in production are exercised in CI too. A
  pre-parsed fixture tests the test.
* **Resolution is explicit, and a miss raises.** Falling back to the network on
  an unmapped URL turns "offline CI" into "CI that's online sometimes", which is
  the failure you don't find until it's flaky.

The routes come from the project — `ingest/fixtures.py` has this one's.

    Raises `KeyError` rather than returning None — an unmapped URL means the
    fixture set has drifted from the pipeline, and that should stop CI rather
    than quietly reach for the network.

    A route whose template names something the pattern doesn't capture raises
    `ValueError`, not `KeyError`, and the distinction is the point: callers wrap
    the `KeyError` in "no fixture mapped for this URL — go re-record", which is
    the wrong advice entirely for a URL that matched a route and then failed to
